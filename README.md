# SnakeGame.
The first mobile phone bought by my father was a Nokia 1108.✨
I used to play the snake game almost everytime.
It’s one of the most iconic games in mobile history. Every person had a high-score, every person was determined to better someone else’s score. It was a never-ending battle between friends and family. Whenever you met someone with a Nokia phone the same question was always asked: “What’s your high-score on Snake?”

So, I tried to recreate one of my favorite games of childhood-The snake game using HTML and JavaScript .
What’s your high-score?
